# AStar
A Python implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

Given a series of points that form the boundary of a region that is to be avoided, the goal of this algorithm is to find the shortest route around the obstacle.

The documentation for this project is in [the wiki.](https://github.com/wrongsyntax/AStar/wiki)
